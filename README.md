# Quadcopter

In the field of RC avionics, developing autonomous aerial vehicles that can navigate predefined routes is both an exciting and practical challenge. Using flight controller and ESCs, you can create a quadcopter capable of flying with precision and stability.

This guide will help you explore the potential of autonomous aerial navigation with an engaging and hands-on project: Building a Quadcopter.

## Components Required:
1. Brushless Motor 1400kV (√ó4)
2. 30 Amp ESCs (√ó4)
3. 8045 Propellers (√ó4)
4. FlySky FS-CT6B Transmitter and Receiver (√ó1)
5. X Drone Frame (√ó1)
